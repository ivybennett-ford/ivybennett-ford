### Hi!! I'm Ivy. I am a research engineer and physics grad working part time. This README, much like myself, is a work in progress!

Stars and water hold my attention nearly 86% of the time. The rest of my attention goes to studying the history of inequality, abolition, 
and extant weaving practices. 

- I'm currently researching and designing novel techniques for scoring Northeastern US cities and townships for fairness. 
- Want to connect? You can find me [here](linkdin), [here](twitter), and [here](website tbd)
